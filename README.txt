CASE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
=========================

Nuxeo Case Management Framework is a framework based on our open source ECM platform Nuxeo Enterprise Platform (EP). It enables you to create applications dedicated to management of documents composed of items that evolve by being transfered to different persons responsible for their review or approval. A case can be for instance: a loan case composed of the different documents required for loan processing; a mail envelope with one or several documents; a legal case, etc.
