<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Purpose of this document</h2>
<p>This document contains a set of tests allowing to ensure that the
Nuxeo Case Management project works well.</p>

<p>Nuxeo Case Management Framework is a framework based on our open
source ECM platform Nuxeo Enterprise Platform (EP). It enables you to
create applications dedicated to the management of documents composed of
items, that evolve by being transfered to different persons responsible
for their review or approval. For instance, a case can be a loan case
composed of the different mandatory documents, a mail envelope with one
or several documents, a legal case, etc.</p>

<p>Based on Nuxeo Enterprise Platform (EP) like all Nuxeo ECM
solutions, Nuxeo Case Management uses some principles of Nuxeo Document
Management (DM) application, such as the access rights management in
filing folders, users and vocabularies management, relations creation,
etc. References to the Nuxeo DM User Guide for these common features are
available in this guide.</p>
